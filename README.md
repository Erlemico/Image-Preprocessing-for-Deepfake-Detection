# Image-Preprocessing-for-Deepfake-Detection
This project involves pre-processing images and videos to reduce noise and clarify facial features in an effort to detect deepfakes. Techniques such as face alignment, histogram equalization, and noise reduction can be used before further detection, which aims to identify images or videos that have been edited using AI technology.
